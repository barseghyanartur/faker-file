- It's always safe to upgrade within the same minor version (for example, from
  0.3 to 0.3.4).
- Minor version changes might be backwards incompatible. Read the
  release notes carefully before upgrading (for example, when upgrading from
  0.3.4 to 0.4).
- All backwards incompatible changes are mentioned in this document.

0.17.2
------
2023-07-25

- Added ``JSON`` file provider.

0.17.1
------
2023-07-21

- Added ``WeasyPrintImageGenerator`` image generator class based
  on `WeasyPrint`_ and `pdf2image`_ packages.
- Added ``BMP``, ``TIFF`` and ``GIF`` file providers (both text-to-image
  and graphic ones). Note, that above mentioned text-to-image providers
  are using ``WeasyPrintImageGenerator`` as a default image generator class,
  since ``ImagekitImageGenerator`` class isn't capable of supporting the
  above mentioned file formats.
- Added more helper functions for ``DynamicTemplate`` use for ODT, PDF and
  DOCX file providers to support h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 headings.

0.17

2023-07-12

.. note::

    Release is dedicated to the victims and de-facto hostages of
    the `Blockade of the Republic of Artsakh`_. Have you ever heard
    of `Armenian genocide`_? It's happening again and the world
    silently watches.

- Introducing graphic image providers. Prior to this release, images have
  been created using text-to-image solutions. Sometimes it's just handy to
  have a graphic image. Therefore, a number of graphic image file providers
  have been created (including inner functions support). The following graphic
  file providers have been added: ``GraphicIcoFileProvider``,
  ``GraphicJpegFileProvider``, ``GraphicPdfFileProvider``,
  ``GraphicPngFileProvider`` and ``GraphicWebpFileProvider`` to support
  creation of graphic ``ICO``, ``JPEG``, ``PDF``, ``PNG`` and ``WEBP`` files.
- The previously mentioned text-to-image rendering has been delegated to
  image generators. Default generator is still based on the `imgkit`_, but
  the change makes it possible to use custom generators.

0.16.4
------
2023-07-01

- Documentation improvements. Added a dedicated section for creating ODT files.
- Adding ``add_paragraph`` and ``add_page_break`` to ``ODT`` contrib module.

0.16.3
------
2023-06-30

- Documentation improvements. Added a dedicated section for creating PDF files.
  Added a dedicated section for creating DOCX files.
- Adding ``add_paragraph`` and ``add_page_break`` to ``DOCX`` contrib module.

0.16.2
------
2023-06-28

- Moving some of the snippets from tests to a ``contrib`` module to improve
  usability. The snippets are generic enough to be used in tests and if you
  don't like the way they work, you could always make a new one. New snippets
  to insert page breaks and paragraphs into PDF (using both `pdfkit`_
  and `reportlab`_ generators) have been added.

0.16.1
------
2023-06-23

- Better error handling in CLI.

0.16
----
2023-06-21

.. note::

    This release is dedicated to my beloved son - Tigran, who turned 11!

.. note::

    This release introduces minor backwards incompatible changes.

- Minor improvements in PDF generation. If you have been using
  ``DynamicTemplate`` to generate complex PDFs, you are likely affected
  by the change. Make sure to at least add an additional argument
  named ``generator`` to the functions passed to the ``DynamicTemplate``
  class. See the example below:

  Old:

    ``def add_pb(provider, story, data, counter, **kwargs):``

  New:

    ``def add_pb(provider, generator, story, data, counter, **kwargs):``

- Add code examples of how to generate a PDF with 100 pages with
  both ``PdfkitPdfGenerator`` and ``ReportlabPdfGenerator`` PDF generator
  classes.
- Add ``version`` CLI command.
- Add ``generate-completion`` and ``version`` commands to the CLI
  auto-completion.

0.15.5
------
2023-06-18

- Minor fixes and documentation improvements.

0.15.4
------
2023-06-15

- Improved ``SFTPStorage`` tests.
- Stop testing against Python 3.7.
- Stop testing against Django 4.0.

0.15.3
------
2023-06-14

- Add ``SFTPStorage`` and correspondent tests.

0.15.2
------
2023-06-08

- Add optional ``subject`` argument to the ``EmlFileProvider``. Update
  tests accordingly.
- Add data integrity tests.

0.15.1
------
2023-06-06

- Added ``FileFromPathProvider`` provider, which simply picks a file
  from path given. Add correspondent ``create_inner_file_from_path``
  inner function.

0.15
----
2023-06-05

- Added ``format_func`` argument to most of the providers. This allows to
  control which formatter function will be used as a default formatter.
  Previously it has been ``faker.provider.Python.pystr_format``, which has
  been changed to ``faker.provider.Python.parse``, since the latter is
  more convenient (as it does not transform characters
  like ``?``, ``!``, ``#`` into something else using ``bothify`` method).
  To revert this behaviour, make sure to pass a callable
  function ``faker_file.base.pystr_format_func`` in ``format_func`` argument
  to each correspondent provider or inner function.
- Added ``create_inner_random_file_from_dir`` inner function.
- Tested against Django 4.2.
- Stop testing against Django 2.2.

0.14.5
------
2023-05-11

- Minor fixes in ``xml_file`` provider.

0.14.4
------
2023-05-11

- Changed type of ``data_columns`` for ``xml_file`` provider from
  ``Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]`` to ``Dict[str, str]``.
- In the ``pdf_file`` provider, changed default value of ``pdf_generator_cls``
  from concrete ``PdfkitPdfGenerator`` value to its' string representation
  faker_file.providers.pdf_file.generators.pdfkit_generator.PdfkitPdfGenerator.
- In the ``mp3_file`` provider, changed default value of ``mp3_generator_cls``
  from concrete ``GttsMp3Generator`` value to its' string representation
  faker_file.providers.mp3_file.generators.gtts_generator.GttsMp3Generator.

0.14.3
------
2023-05-10

- Minor fixes in the ``GenericFileProvider``.

0.14.2
------
2023-05-09

- Add ``create_inner_generic_file`` inner function.
- Add ``generic_file`` support to CLI.

0.14.1
------
2023-05-08

- Add support for ``list_create_inner_file``-like functions to the ``EML``
  file provider. If you are using CLI and CLI-completion, make sure to
  re-generate the completion file.
- Add ``GenericFileProvider`` provider to support generic file types.

0.14
----
2023-05-07

.. note::

    This release introduces minor backwards incompatible changes.

- A new argument ``basename`` has been added to all providers, inner
  functions and storage classes. If you have customized things or created
  your own providers, make sure to make appropriate changes in your code.
  See the source code for more implementation examples. If you are using
  CLI and CLI-completion, make sure to re-generate the completion file.
- A new inner function ``list_create_inner_file`` has been added, using which
  it's possible to create just a list of given files (ignoring ``count`` value)
  using given arguments. The amount of files is determined by
  the ``func_list`` (each pair ``(Callable, kwargs)`` corresponds to a single
  file. Both ``ZipFileProvider`` and ``TarFileProvider`` have been altered to
  reflect these changes.
- Added to support for ``XML`` files through ``XmlFileProvider``.

0.13
----
2023-05-05

.. note::

    This release introduces minor backwards incompatible changes.

- Display full path to the created file in the CLI.
- Added ``DynamicTemplate`` support for ``PDF`` file. The ``generate``
  method of the ``BasePdfGenerator`` and classes derived from it,
  got two new arguments: ``data`` (``Dict[str, Any]``),
  and ``provider`` (``Union[Faker, Generator, Provider]``). If you have
  implemented custom generators for ``PDF`` (``pdf_file`` provider),
  make sure to reflect mentioned changes in your code.

0.12.6
------
2023-05-02

- Added ``DynamicTemplate`` support for ``DOCX`` and ``ODT`` files.

0.12.5
------
2023-04-24

.. note::

    In memory of the victims of the
    `Armenian Genocide <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide>`_.

------
2023-04-22

- Make it possible to load classes from strings for passing as arguments
  to ``mp3_file`` and ``pdf_file`` providers.

0.12.3
------
2023-04-21

- Fixes in CLI options.

0.12.2
------
2023-04-20

- Added CLI options.

0.12
----
2023-02-24

*Note, that this release introduces breaking changes!*

- Make it easy to use a different PDF library with ``PdfFileProvider`` by
  adding ``pdf_generator_cls`` and ``pdf_generator_kwargs`` optional arguments
  to the ``pdf_file`` method. Added ``ReportlabPdfGenerator`` class based on
  the famous ``reportlab`` library. Default is still ``PdfkitPdfGenerator``.
  Since ``encoding`` was something specific for ``pdfkit`` library,
  it was moved from ``pdf_file`` method to ``PdfkitPdfGenerator``, to which it
  can be passed in ``pdf_generator_kwargs``. If you have passed the
  ``encoding`` argument explicitly, make sure to make correspondent changes.
  Note, that using the new ``ReportlabPdfGenerator`` class could speed-up PDF
  generation by about 40 times.

0.11.5
------
2023-02-20

- Fixes in typing of ``CsvFileProvider``. ``Tuple[str, str]``
  becomes ``Tuple[str, ...]``.

  ``Mp3FileProvider`` provider (``StringValue``, ``BytesValue``).

0.11.3
------
2023-02-10

- Moved several interface classes from one location to another. If you haven't
  implemented custom generators, this won't affect you. If you did, make sure
  to update your imports:

      ``faker_file.providers.augment_file_from_dir.extractors.base`` to
      ``faker_file.providers.base.text_extractor``.
    - ``BaseMp3Generator`` has been moved from
      ``faker_file.providers.mp3_file.generators.base`` to
